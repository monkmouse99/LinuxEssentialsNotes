# LinuxEssentialsNotes
To my mind, learning Linux is a bit like playing a Nintendo Zelda game.  It's broad, expansive, and it requires wandering here and there before winning the next achievement required to level-up.  Once you level-up, you often wander around the same territory with your new wisdom and tools seeing things you didn't see in the past.  It is that similarity to Zelda that makes the  Linux topic challenging to document.  Linux topics tends to meander into other topics, yet the learner may not be ready for the next level.   

To add to the complexity, Linux is constantly changing unlike Zelda which does not change once you buy the game.  If you wander back, you may find your knowledge and/or toolset no longer works as expected.  For me, this is why the topic of learning Linux is a bit more challenging than topics that fit nicely within a storyline.  Linux requires a bit more commitment from the learner.  

Let's begin the journey with a destination in mind which is passing the Linux Essentials test.  The test objectives can be found below in the Important Links section, and I've broken up the domains similar to the LPI topics along with additional resources should someone want to wander around the topic a bit further.  Ultimately, I'd like to create a different study guide for the LPIC tests as they build upon one another, but I thought I'd start with trying to structure the Essentials topics first.
