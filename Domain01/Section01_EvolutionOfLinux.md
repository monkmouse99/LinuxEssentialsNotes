# What is a Linux Distribution
The [Linux Professional Institute](https://learning.lpi.org/en/learning-materials/010-160/1/1.1/1.1_01/) provides a goal in addition to a defintion.  They state that "the goal is to optimized the kernel and the applications that run on the operating system for a certain use case or user group."  This explains the mulitude of distributions or "distros" available.  A desktop distribution will serve different needs than a distribution intended for an entprise server or an embedded system.  </br>
