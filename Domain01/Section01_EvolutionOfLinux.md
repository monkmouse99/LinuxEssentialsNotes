Frank Herbert wrote in Dune that *"a beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct."*  IMO, attempting to delve into the history of Linux requires the same delicate approach. Unless we create a time machine, it will be difficult for many to understand the forces that led Richard Stallman to develop an open source (free to copy/use/edit) operating system which Linux Torvalds added his well-known kernel.  

Power cables for different technology devices may be the best starting point for this beginning.  Many people have different technology devices in their homes including TV media boxes (ex. Roku, Apple TV), gaming consoles (Nintendo switch, Xbox, Ps4, etc), and laptops.  Each manufacturer tends to provide a different connector, and the consumer has to find a specific replacement for that cable.  Each technology company owns their propietary piece of the market, and the consumer is at the mercy of the vendor in most cases.  Welcome to the early history of computers in the 50s, 60s and 70s where a few names dominated the market with a limited number of proprietary products because very few companies had the need nor the funds for mainframe or mini.  As we entered the 1980s, computer costs were dropping significantly as personal computers became a reality.  Legacy computer companies saw new competitors emerge every week, and most companies attempted to protect their propietary investments through tight control.

# What is a Linux Distribution
The [Linux Professional Institute](https://learning.lpi.org/en/learning-materials/010-160/1/1.1/1.1_01/) provides a goal in addition to a defintion.  They state that "the goal is to optimized the kernel and the applications that run on the operating system for a certain use case or user group."  This explains the mulitude of distributions or "distros" available.  A desktop distribution will serve different needs than a distribution intended for an entprise server or an embedded system.  </br>

*Distribution Compontents*

2. Applications
3. GNU Utilities
4. Package Management Utility (software installations)
